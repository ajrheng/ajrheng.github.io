<!-- Our proposed methods are (i) fast: It takes about 7.2ms with an single image as input and runs at over 50fps (19.2ms) on a single CPU core or over 130fps (7.2ms) on multiple CPU cores (i5-8259U processor), (ii) accurate: By dynamically optimizing 3DMM parameters through a novel meta-optimization strategy combining the fast WPDC and VDC, we surpass the state-of-the-art results, and (iii) stable: In a mini-batch, one still image is transformed slightly and smoothly into a short synthetic video, which provides temporal information of adjacent frames for training. -->
We propose a novel regression framework which makes a balance among speed, accuracy and stability. Firstly, on the basis of a lightweight backbone, we propose a meta-joint optimization strategy
to dynamically regress a small set of 3DMM parameters, which greatly enhances speed and accuracy simultaneously. To further improve the stability on videos, we present a virtual synthesis method to transform one still image to a short-video incorporating in-plane and out-of-plane face moving. Our model runs at over 50fps on a single CPU core and outperforms other state-of-the-art heavy models simultaneously. Code and models will be available at <a>https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA_V2</a>.
